** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 56.
** Token involved: COMMA
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

LET option(REC) VAR list(arg) option(annot) EQ LPAREN expr2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:

** In state 56, looking ahead at COMMA, reducing production
** expr -> expr2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

LPAREN expr COMMA expr RPAREN // lookahead token appears
       expr2 . 

** In state 56, looking ahead at COMMA, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

LPAREN expr COLON ty RPAREN 
       expr2 
       expr2 . COMMA expr2
